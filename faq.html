            <div>
              <p>This Marketo survey shows that the highest proportion of a companies marketing budget is invested in website optimisation followed by social media and SEO. Why? Because the marketing industry has moved from aggressive advertising to lead generation.</p>
              <p>It is both cheaper and provides a better ROI to have a fully bespoke, optimised website and digital marketing strategy and to let customers come to you than to aimlessly push ads into the wrong channels. If companies are spending so much money trying to get traffic to their website, then you need to ensure the website is fit for purpose.</p>

              <p>Tough to answer. How much does it cost to build a house? Depends on the requirements, functionality, scale, attention to detail and much more. We price projects from a minimum of £500 anywhere up to tens of thousands of pounds.</p>
              <p>Ultimately we price a project based on the expected ROI that you receive. The more money it will make you in the long run, the more we charge.</p>

            <div>
              <p>User experience or UX design is the process of starting the design of a product with the user first. First we do research to understand who the users are. Then we understand what their needs & frustrations are. Then we create user personas based on the research in order to allow us to think like the users.</p>
              <p>Once we know exactly what the users want and what they expect we can create a user journey to plot out the steps required to generate a sale or generate a lead. A large part of user experience design is usability testing where we take a prototype of website, show it to actual users and get them to complete tasks and observe them to identify problems in the design. It takes out all the guesswork.</p>
